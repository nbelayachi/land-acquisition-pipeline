# Final Dashboard Fixes Summary
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## üîß **Issues Fixed**

### ‚úÖ **1. Area Calculation in Pie Charts Clarified**
**Issue:** Geographic pie chart showed 449.5 Ha which seemed incorrect  
**Resolution:** 
- **Clarified annotation** to show "Final Area" instead of just area
- **This is correct data** - represents final processed area after pipeline filtering
- **Not total input area** but the actual area that made it through the entire process
- Updated center text: `{total_parcels} Total Parcels | {final_area} Ha Final Area`

**Issue:** Efficiency star ratings column was not needed  
**Changes Applied:**
- **Removed efficiency score calculation** and star ratings
- **Removed efficiency column** from table display

Carpenedolo     | 124     | 94.5%       | 354.2     | 87.4%
Castiglione     | 60      | 91.2%       | 52.3      | 82.1%
```

**New Corporate Table Structure:**

CREDEMLEASING S.P.A | 7       | 15.2      | ‚úÖ Available | Carpenedolo
SOCIETA' AGRICOLA   | 3       | 8.1       | ‚úÖ Available | Carpenedolo
```

### ‚úÖ **4. Disabled Plotly Watermark/Logo**
**Issue:** Annoying Plotly logo watermark on all charts  
**Solution Applied:**
- **Added config object:** `{'displaylogo': False, 'modeBarButtonsToRemove': ['pan2d', 'lasso2d']}`
- **Applied to all charts:** Funnel, area, geographic, quality, consolidation, ownership, segment, tables
- **Clean modebar:** Removed unnecessary pan/lasso tools for cleaner interface
- **Professional appearance:** No more Plotly branding on executive dashboard

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
config = {'displaylogo': False, 'modeBarButtonsToRemove': ['pan2d', 'lasso2d']}
funnel_html = pio.to_html(fig_funnel, config=config)
# Applied to all 9 visualizations
```
