## üìå Executive Summary

The Land Acquisition Pipeline is a sophisticated Python-based system that automates the Italian real estate acquisition workflow. It processes property data through official APIs, identifies and contacts landowners, and provides actionable business intelligence for acquisition campaigns.

### Core Value Proposition

* **Automates** weeks of manual work into hours
* **Reduces contacts by 93%** through intelligent deduplication (e.g., 70 records ‚Üí 5 contacts)
* **Saves ‚Ç¨0.50 per contact** through smart routing and deduplication
* **Classifies address quality** to minimize returned mail (40% direct mail vs 60% agency)
* **Enhances addresses** with ZIP codes and 17+ geographic fields
* **Retrieves certified PEC emails** for B2B contacts (100% success rate)
* **Provides 13+ business metrics** for data-driven decisions

## üîÑ Complete Operational Workflow

### Phase 1: Input & Manual Checks

1. **Technical Team** identifies target parcels (500-1000 Ha typical)
2. Creates Excel with required fields:
   - `tipo_catasto` (usually 'T' for Terreni)
   - `CP` (Connection Point identifier)
   - `provincia` (Province code)
   - `comune` (Municipality name)
   - `foglio` (Sheet number)
   - `particella` (Parcel number)
   - `Area` (Size in hectares)
   - `Sezione` (Optional - required for some municipalities)

3. **Sezione Verification**: For municipalities like Bologna or Valsamoggia, the Land Manager must check the SISTER portal for correct Sezione data

### Phase 2: Campaign Launch

1. Run `python campaign_launcher.py`
2. Select input Excel file
3. Review campaign analysis (parcels, municipalities, CPs)
4. Enter starting API balance for cost tracking
5. Confirm launch ‚Üí generates campaign configuration JSON

### Phase 3: Automated Processing

The pipeline processes each municipality through these steps:

#### 3.1 Get Owners (Catasto API)
- Retrieves all property owners for each parcel
- Handles multiple owners per parcel (common scenario)
- Saves timeout requests for later recovery

#### 3.2 Owner Classification
- **Privato**: Individual owners (CF starts with letter)
- **Azienda**: Company owners (CF starts with digit)

#### 3.3 Data Enhancement
- **Address Cleaning**: Removes apartment/floor information
- **Geocoding**: Adds ZIP codes and 17 geographic fields
- **PEC Lookup**: Retrieves certified emails for companies

#### 3.4 Address Quality Intelligence (v2.7 Enhancement)
Analyzes each address to determine routing channel:

| Confidence | Criteria | Routing | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|
| HIGH | Complete verified address | DIRECT_MAIL | "Via Roma 42, 00100 Roma" |
| MEDIUM | Minor issues (number mismatch) | DIRECT_MAIL | Original "79" vs Geocoded "75" |
| LOW | Missing/interpolated numbers | AGENCY | "Via Sarmato" (no number) |
| LOW | SNC (Senza Numero Civico) | AGENCY | "Strada Cervellina SNC" |

#### 3.5 Deduplication
- Creates unique contact list based on CF + cleaned address
- Typical reduction: 70 raw records ‚Üí 5 unique contacts (93% reduction)

### Phase 4: Output Generation

For each municipality, creates:

1. **Validation_Ready.xlsx** - Deduplicated contacts for Land Acquisition team
2. **Companies_Found.xlsx** - Company owners with PEC emails
3. **Municipality_Summary** - 13 business intelligence metrics
4. **Raw_Data.xlsx** - Complete unfiltered dataset

Plus campaign-wide files:
- **PowerBI_Dataset.csv** - For dashboard analytics
- **Campaign_Summary.xlsx** - Executive overview
- **Enhanced_Cost_Summary.txt** - Detailed cost breakdown

### Phase 5: Distribution & Execution

* Results auto-sync to OneDrive for team access
* **Land Acquisition Team** processes Validation_Ready files
* **Business Development** contacts companies via PEC
* **Management** analyzes PowerBI dashboards

## ‚ú® Key Features & Intelligence

### Address Quality Classification (v2.7)

The system's most sophisticated feature, preventing wasted costs on returned mail:

```python
# Example classification logic
if 'SNC' in address:
    return 'LOW confidence ‚Üí AGENCY'
elif original_number == geocoded_number:
    return 'HIGH confidence ‚Üí DIRECT_MAIL'
elif original_number != geocoded_number:
    return 'MEDIUM confidence ‚Üí DIRECT_MAIL (use original)'
elif not original_number and geocoded_number:
    return 'LOW confidence ‚Üí AGENCY (interpolated)'
```

### Business Metrics (v2.8 Validated)

| Metric | Description | Business Value |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| API_Success_Rate | % of parcels with owner data | Pipeline reliability |
| Contact_Reduction_Rate | Raw records ‚Üí Final contacts | Cost savings |
| High_Confidence_Direct_Mail | Addresses ready for mailing | Cheap channel volume |
| Agency_Required_Final | Addresses needing manual handling | Expensive channel volume |
| Interpolation_Risks_Detected | Potentially fake addresses | Quality warning |
| Hectares_Direct_Mail | Land area via direct mail | Coverage efficiency |
| PEC_Success_Rate | Companies with email found | B2B opportunity |
| Address_Geocoding_Success_Rate | ZIP codes found | Enhancement effectiveness |

### Timeout Recovery System

- Automatically saves failed API requests
- Attempts recovery after main processing
- Typical recovery rate: 80%+
- Saves ~‚Ç¨0.50 per recovered request

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Key Configuration Options

```json
{
  "geocoding_settings": {
    "enabled": true,  // ZIP code enhancement
    "token": "your-token-here"
  },
  "pec_integration": {
    "enabled": true,  // Company email lookup
    "token": "your-token-here"
  },
  "output_structure": {
    "onedrive_sync_path": "path/to/OneDrive/folder",
    "auto_copy_to_onedrive": true
  }
}
```

## üìä Production Insights

Based on real campaign data analysis:

### Typical Campaign Profile
- **Input**: 1-5 parcels per municipality
- **Multiplication**: 1 parcel ‚Üí 20-70 raw records (multiple owners)
- **Reduction**: 93% fewer contacts after deduplication
- **Quality**: 60% of addresses require expensive agency handling
- **Companies**: 10-20% of parcels are company-owned

### Cost Structure
- **API calls**: ~‚Ç¨0.50 per parcel
- **Direct mail**: ~‚Ç¨0.20 per contact
- **Agency handling**: ~‚Ç¨0.70 per contact
- **Current blended cost**: ~‚Ç¨0.44 per contact (with 60% agency rate)

### Optimization Opportunities
- Reducing agency rate from 60% to 40% would save ‚Ç¨0.06 per contact
- On a 1000-contact campaign: ‚Ç¨60 savings
- Address Quality Intelligence (future) could achieve this

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **High Agency Routing Rate**
   - Cause: Poor address quality in source data
   - Solution: Focus on municipalities with better addresses

2. **Timeout Errors**
   - Cause: API overload or network issues
   - Solution: Recovery system handles automatically

3. **Missing Sezione**
   - Cause: Required for some municipalities
   - Solution: Check SISTER portal before processing

4. **No Companies Found**
   - Normal for residential areas
   - Companies typically own 10-20% of parcels

### Performance Tips

- Process municipalities with <50 parcels first
- Run campaigns during Italian business hours
- Clear cache files older than 6 months
- Monitor API balance during large campaigns
