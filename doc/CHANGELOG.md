## [3.1.5] - 2025-07-04 📬 USABILITY ENHANCEMENT

### ✨ **Major Features**
- **Enhanced `Final_Mailing_List` Structure**: The `Final_Mailing_List` sheet has been significantly improved for usability by the land acquisition team.
  - **New Columns**: Added `cf` (fiscal code), `Addresses_Per_Owner`, and `Address_Sequence` to provide clear, at-a-glance information about each owner's contact points.
  - **Owner-Based Sorting**: The entire sheet is now sorted by the owner's fiscal code (`cf`), grouping all addresses for a single owner together.

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
- Modified the `create_final_mailing_list` function to include the new columns and apply the sorting logic.

### 📊 **Business Impact**
- **Improved Mailing Efficiency**: The new structure makes it significantly easier and faster for the mailing team to process the list, consolidate communications for owners with multiple properties, and avoid confusion.
- **Enhanced Clarity**: The `Addresses_Per_Owner` and `Address_Sequence` columns provide immediate context, reducing the need for manual cross-referencing and potential errors.
- **No Impact on Core Metrics**: This is a usability enhancement and does not change any of the core metric calculations in the `Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis` or `Campaign_Summary` sheets.

## [3.1.4] - 2025-07-04 🎯 ADDRESS CLASSIFICATION REFINEMENT

### ✨ **Major Features**
- **Refined Address Confidence Logic**: The `classify_address_quality_enhanced` function has been updated to be more aligned with business needs. Certain addresses previously classified as `MEDIUM` confidence are now elevated to `HIGH` confidence if they are considered deliverable, even with minor geocoding discrepancies. This primarily affects addresses where the original input address is deemed reliable by the business.

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
- Modified the `classify_address_quality_enhanced` function to incorporate the new business logic for elevating address confidence.

### 📊 **Business Impact**
- **Increased Mailing List Size**: This change will result in a larger pool of `HIGH` confidence addresses, increasing the number of contacts in the `Final_Mailing_List` that can be processed automatically.
- **Reduced Manual Review**: By automatically elevating the confidence of reliable addresses, the need for manual review of certain `MEDIUM` confidence addresses is reduced, saving time and effort.

## [3.1.3] - 2025-07-03 📈 ENHANCED METRICS CLARITY & COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

### ✨ **Major Features**
- **Refined Contact Processing Funnel Metrics**: The `Retention_Rate` for stages within the "Contact Processing" funnel (e.g., "Address Expansion", "Direct Mail Ready") is now strictly calculated relative to the "1. Owner Discovery" count, providing a consistent and business-sensible view of overall contact retention.
- **New Metric: `Stage_Conversion_Rate`**: Introduced a new column in `Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis` to explicitly show the conversion rate from the *immediately preceding relevant stage*. This provides granular insight into step-wise efficiency without confusing overall retention.
- **Comprehensive Metrics Guide (`METRICS_GUIDE.md`)**: Created a new, detailed documentation file explaining every metric across `Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis`, `Address_Quality_Distribution`, and `Campaign_Summary`. Each metric includes its business rationale, calculation details, and real-world examples from a sample campaign.

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
- Modified `create_funnel_analysis_df` function to implement the new `Retention_Rate` and `Stage_Conversion_Rate` calculations for the Contact Processing Funnel.
- Created `doc/METRICS_GUIDE.md` as a central reference for all pipeline metrics.

### 📊 **Business Impact**
- **Unambiguous Metric Interpretation**: Eliminates confusion around `Retention_Rate` in the Contact Processing funnel, providing clearer insights into contact flow and efficiency.
- **Enhanced Granular Analysis**: The `Stage_Conversion_Rate` allows for precise identification of bottlenecks and optimization opportunities at each step of the contact processing.
- **Improved Stakeholder Understanding**: The `METRICS_GUIDE.md` serves as a single source of truth for all metrics, empowering business users to fully understand and leverage the pipeline's output for strategic decision-making.

## [3.1.1] - 2025-07-03 📊 METRICS CLARITY & ACCURACY FIXES

### ✨ **Major Features**
- **Business-Friendly Funnel**: Renamed technical stage names in `Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis` to be clear and intuitive for business stakeholders (e.g., "Category A Filter" is now "Parcels w/ Residential Buildings").
- **Multiplier Metrics**: Changed "Owner Discovery" and "Address Expansion" rates from percentages to multipliers (e.g., 1.25x) to accurately reflect data enrichment instead of conversion.
- **Enhanced Process Notes**: Added detailed, business-focused explanations to each stage of the funnel, clarifying the purpose and impact of each step.

### 🔧 **Bug Fixes**
- **Corrected Percentage Rounding**: Fixed the rounding logic in the `Address_Quality_Distribution` sheet to ensure the total always sums to exactly 100.0%, preventing presentation errors in reports.

### 📊 **Business Impact**
- **Improved Stakeholder Communication**: Funnel metrics are now significantly clearer and easier for non-technical audiences to understand, reducing confusion and improving decision-making.
- **Accurate Reporting**: Corrected rounding ensures that all quality distribution reports are mathematically accurate and professional.
- **Enhanced Data Storytelling**: The improved labels and notes allow the data to tell a more coherent story about the land acquisition process.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-07-01 🚀 NEW MAILING FORMAT & ENHANCED PARSING

### ✨ **Features**
- **Added Strategic Mailing List**: Implemented a new primary output sheet named `Strategic_Mailing_List`. This sheet provides a comprehensive overview grouped by the initial input parcels. For each parcel group, it lists all unique owners and all of their known high-confidence mailing addresses, enabling complex campaign strategies.

### 🔧 **Fixes**
- **Refined Street Number Extraction**: Modified the address parsing logic to be more conservative. The script no longer incorrectly extracts numbers that are part of a proper street name (e.g., "Via 4 Novembre"). This increases the accuracy of address classification and prevents valid addresses from being downgraded.

---

- **Address Completeness Score**: Each address is now scored based on the presence of critical fields (`Street_Name`, `Postal_Code`, `City`), which feeds into the final confidence assessment.

### ⚙️ **Internal**
- **Configurable Thresholds**: All confidence and completeness thresholds are now configurable in the `land_acquisition_config.json` file.
- **Refactored `classify_address_quality`**: The function was split into `classify_address_quality_enhanced` and a legacy original version for better maintainability.

## [2.9.9] - 2025-07-01 🔧 FIXED ADDRESS PARSING

### 🔧 **Fixes**
- **Refined Street Number Extraction**: Modified the address parsing logic to be more conservative. The script no longer incorrectly extracts numbers that are part of a proper street name (e.g., "Via 4 Novembre"). This increases the accuracy of address classification and prevents valid addresses from being downgraded.
