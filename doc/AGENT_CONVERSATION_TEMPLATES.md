# 💬 Agent Conversation Templates
**Essential Scripts for Maintaining Project Organization**

## 🎯 **Purpose**
These templates ensure every agent consistently prompts for and executes proper project maintenance alongside technical work.

---

## 📋 **MANDATORY CONVERSATION STARTERS**

### **Template 1: Before Any Implementation**
```
"Before I implement [specific request], I need to also perform project maintenance:

1. 📚 Update documentation to reflect the changes
2. 📁 Check file organization and archive outdated files
3. 🔄 Verify version consistency across all files
4. 🧹 Ensure the project structure remains clean

This ensures the next agent has a clear, up-to-date project. Should I proceed with this comprehensive approach?"
```

### **Template 2: After Major Changes**
```
"I've completed [implemented feature]. Now I need to perform the standard maintenance cycle:

✅ Update README.md with new features
✅ Add CHANGELOG.md entry
✅ Update HANDOFF_GUIDE.md with new function locations  
✅ Archive any superseded files
✅ Verify folder organization

This keeps the project documentation current and organized. Shall I execute this maintenance?"
```

### **Template 3: When Files Need Organization**
```
"I notice the project has accumulated development files that need organization:

📦 [X] files should be archived from dev_tools/
📁 Analysis outputs should move to outputs/analysis_results/
🗂️ Test files should be categorized in dev_tools/testing/
📄 Documentation needs updating to reflect current state

Should I perform this organization cleanup to prepare for future development?"
```

---

## 🔄 **MAINTENANCE WORKFLOW SCRIPTS**

### **Script 1: Documentation Update Prompt**
```
"The documentation appears to be behind the current implementation. I should update:

📖 README.md - Add new features and current status
📝 CHANGELOG.md - Add entry for version [X.X.X]
🤝 HANDOFF_GUIDE.md - Update function locations (lines X-Y)
🔧 TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md - Add implementation details
📊 PROJECT_STATUS - Mark features as completed

This ensures new agents can immediately understand the current state. Proceed?"
```

### **Script 2: File Organization Audit**
```
"I'll perform a file organization audit:

🔍 Root directory: Check for clutter (target: ≤5 files)
📂 dev_tools/: Categorize and archive old files
🗃️ Archive: Move [list files] to dev_tools/archive/
📊 Outputs: Move analysis results to outputs/analysis_results/
✅ Verification: Ensure all files are properly categorized

This maintains the clean project structure. Should I proceed?"
```

### **Script 3: Version Consistency Check**
```
"I need to verify version consistency across the project:

🔢 Current version: v[X.X.X]
📄 Files to check: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, config files
🔍 Search for: Outdated version references
✏️ Update: Any inconsistent version numbers
📋 Document: Version changes in appropriate files

This ensures all documentation reflects the actual project state. Proceed?"
```

---

## 🚨 **ALERT TEMPLATES**

### **Red Flag Alert 1: Root Directory Clutter**
```
"🚨 ORGANIZATION ALERT: Root directory has [X] files (target: ≤5)

Files that should be moved:
📁 [list files and destinations]

This cleanup is essential for:
- Professional project appearance
- Easy navigation for new agents
- Clear separation of core vs. development files

Should I reorganize these files now?"
```

### **Red Flag Alert 2: Outdated Documentation**
```
"🚨 DOCUMENTATION ALERT: [File] last updated [date] but code changed [date]

Documentation gaps identified:
📖 [specific outdated sections]
🔄 [version inconsistencies]
📋 [missing feature documentation]

This needs immediate attention to ensure agent continuity. Update now?"
```

### **Red Flag Alert 3: Archive Needed**
```
"🚨 ARCHIVE ALERT: [X] obsolete files found in dev_tools/

Files for archiving:
📦 [list version-specific files]
🗂️ [list superseded analysis files]
⏰ [list timestamp-based files]

These files are cluttering the active development space. Archive now?"
```

---

## 📊 **PROGRESS REPORTING TEMPLATES**

### **Maintenance Completion Report**
```
"✅ PROJECT MAINTENANCE COMPLETED

Documentation Updates:
📖 README.md - Updated with [specific changes]
📝 CHANGELOG.md - Added v[X.X.X] entry
🤝 HANDOFF_GUIDE.md - Updated function locations
📊 PROJECT_STATUS - Marked [features] as complete

File Organization:
📦 Archived [X] files from dev_tools/ → dev_tools/archive/
📁 Moved [X] analysis files → outputs/analysis_results/
🗂️ Categorized [X] test files → dev_tools/testing/
✅ Root directory clean ([X] files)

Version Consistency:
🔢 All files updated to v[X.X.X]
📄 [X] version references corrected
✅ Cross-references verified

Next agent can immediately continue with organized, current project."
```

### **Handoff Status Template**
```
"🤝 AGENT HANDOFF STATUS

Current Project State:
✅ All documentation current as of [date]
✅ File organization verified and clean
✅ Version v[X.X.X] consistent across all files
✅ [X] files properly archived
✅ No duplicate functionality

Ready for Next Agent:
📖 README.md reflects actual capabilities
🔧 HANDOFF_GUIDE.md has current function locations
📊 All metrics and status documents updated
🗂️ Clean file structure maintained

Project is immediately ready for continued development."
```

## 🎯 **SITUATION-SPECIFIC TEMPLATES**

### **When User Requests "Quick Fix"**
```
"I can implement this quick fix, but I also need to:

⚡ Make the requested change
📚 Update documentation (even for small changes)
🔍 Check if this change affects any existing files
🗂️ Verify no cleanup is needed

Even 'quick fixes' need proper documentation for project continuity. This takes 2 extra minutes but saves hours for the next agent. Proceed?"
```

### **When Implementing New Features**
```
"For this new feature implementation, I'll need to:

🔧 Code Implementation:
   - [technical details]

📚 Documentation Updates:
   - README.md: Add feature description
   - CHANGELOG.md: Add version entry
   - HANDOFF_GUIDE.md: Add function locations
   - TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md: Add implementation details

🗂️ File Organization:
   - Archive any superseded files
   - Organize any new development files
   - Update project structure documentation

This comprehensive approach ensures the feature is properly integrated. Proceed?"
```

### **When Project Gets Messy**
```
"I notice the project needs a maintenance cycle:

🧹 Cleanup Needed:
   - [X] files in root need moving
   - [X] old files need archiving
   - [X] analysis outputs need organizing

📚 Documentation Updates:
   - [list outdated docs]
   - [list version inconsistencies]

This cleanup is essential before any new development. Should I perform this maintenance first?"
```
