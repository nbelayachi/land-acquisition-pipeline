## üìå Executive Summary

The Land Acquisition Pipeline is a sophisticated Python-based system that automates the Italian real estate acquisition workflow. It processes property data through official APIs, identifies and contacts landowners, and provides actionable business intelligence for acquisition campaigns.

### Core Value Proposition

* **Automates** weeks of manual work into hours
* **Reduces contacts by 93%** through intelligent deduplication (e.g., 70 records ‚Üí 5 contacts)
* **Saves ‚Ç¨0.50 per contact** through smart routing and deduplication
* **Classifies address quality** to optimize mail delivery (SNC addresses now direct mail capable)
* **Tracks funnel metrics** showing parcel and hectare flow through each processing stage
* **Enhances addresses** with ZIP codes and 17+ geographic fields
* **Retrieves certified PEC emails** for B2B contacts (100% success rate)
* **Provides 15+ business metrics** including comprehensive funnel analytics

## üîÑ Complete Operational Workflow

### Phase 1: Input & Manual Checks

1. **Technical Team** identifies target parcels (500-1000 Ha typical)
2. Creates Excel with required fields:
   - `tipo_catasto` (usually 'T' for Terreni)
   - `CP` (Connection Point identifier)
   - `provincia` (Province code)
   - `comune` (Municipality name)
   - `foglio` (Sheet number)
   - `particella` (Parcel number)
   - `Area` (Size in hectares)
   - `Sezione` (Optional - required for some municipalities)

3. **Sezione Verification**: For municipalities like Bologna or Valsamoggia, the Land Manager must check the SISTER portal for correct Sezione data

### Phase 2: Campaign Launch

1. Run `python campaign_launcher.py`
2. Select input Excel file
3. Review campaign analysis (parcels, municipalities, CPs)
4. Enter starting API balance for cost tracking
5. Confirm launch ‚Üí generates campaign configuration JSON

### Phase 3: Automated Processing

The pipeline processes each municipality through these steps:

#### 3.1 Get Owners (Catasto API)
- Retrieves all property owners for each parcel
- Handles multiple owners per parcel (common scenario)
- Saves timeout requests for later recovery

#### 3.2 Owner Classification
- **Privato**: Individual owners (CF starts with letter)
- **Azienda**: Company owners (CF starts with digit)

#### 3.3 Data Enhancement
- **Address Cleaning**: Removes apartment/floor information
- **Geocoding**: Adds ZIP codes and 17 geographic fields
- **PEC Lookup**: Retrieves certified emails for companies

#### 3.4 Address Quality Intelligence (v2.9 Enhancement)
Analyzes each address to determine routing channel:

| Confidence | Criteria | Routing | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|
| HIGH | Complete verified address | DIRECT_MAIL | "Via Roma 42, 00100 Roma" |
| HIGH | SNC (Senza Numero Civico) | DIRECT_MAIL | "Via Garibaldi SNC" - known small street |
| MEDIUM | Minor issues (number mismatch) | DIRECT_MAIL | Original "79" vs Geocoded "75" |
| LOW | Missing/interpolated numbers | AGENCY | "Via Sarmato" (no number) |

#### 3.5 Deduplication
- Creates unique contact list based on CF + cleaned address
- Typical reduction: 70 raw records ‚Üí 5 unique contacts (93% reduction)

#### 3.6 Funnel Metrics Tracking (v2.9 Enhancement)
Tracks parcels and hectares through each processing stage:

```
Input Parcels (100 parcels, 150 hectares)
    ‚Üì API Success (95% success rate)
95 parcels with data (142.5 hectares)
    ‚Üì Owner Classification
75 Private parcels (112.5 ha) + 20 Company parcels (30 ha)
    ‚Üì Cat.A Filter (Private only)
60 Residential parcels (90 hectares)
    ‚Üì Deduplication & Enhancement
180 unique contacts generated
    ‚Üì Quality Routing
108 Direct Mail (54 ha) + 72 Agency (36 ha)
```

**Company Tracking**: Companies bypass Cat.A filter but are included in overall metrics with separate visibility.

### Phase 4: Output Generation

For each municipality, creates:

1. **Validation_Ready.xlsx** - Deduplicated contacts for Land Acquisition team
2. **Companies_Found.xlsx** - Company owners with PEC emails
3. **Municipality_Summary** - 15+ business intelligence metrics including funnel data
4. **Raw_Data.xlsx** - Complete unfiltered dataset

Plus campaign-wide files:
- **PowerBI_Dataset.csv** - For dashboard analytics with funnel metrics
- **Campaign_Summary.xlsx** - Executive overview with funnel visualization
- **Enhanced_Cost_Summary.txt** - Detailed cost breakdown

**Note**: v2.9.x will consolidate outputs into a single filterable file for easier team access.

### Phase 5: Distribution & Execution

* Results auto-sync to OneDrive for team access
* **Land Acquisition Team** processes Validation_Ready files
* **Business Development** contacts companies via PEC
* **Management** analyzes PowerBI dashboards

## ‚ú® Key Features & Intelligence

### Address Quality Classification (v2.9)

The system's most sophisticated feature, optimizing mail delivery success:

```python
# Example classification logic
if 'SNC' in address:
    return 'HIGH confidence ‚Üí DIRECT_MAIL (known small street)'
elif original_number == geocoded_number:
    return 'HIGH confidence ‚Üí DIRECT_MAIL'
elif original_number != geocoded_number:
    return 'MEDIUM confidence ‚Üí DIRECT_MAIL (use original)'
elif not original_number and geocoded_number:
    return 'LOW confidence ‚Üí AGENCY (interpolated)'
```

### Business Metrics (v2.9 Enhanced)

**Core Performance Metrics:**

| Metric | Description | Business Value |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| API_Success_Rate | % of parcels with owner data | Pipeline reliability |
| Contact_Reduction_Rate | Raw records ‚Üí Final contacts | Cost savings |
| High_Confidence_Direct_Mail | Addresses ready for mailing (includes SNC) | Cheap channel volume |
| Agency_Required_Final | Addresses needing manual handling | Expensive channel volume |
| PEC_Success_Rate | Companies with email found | B2B opportunity |
| Address_Geocoding_Success_Rate | ZIP codes found | Enhancement effectiveness |

**Funnel Tracking Metrics (NEW):**

| Metric | Description | Management Insight |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Input_Parcels / Input_Area_Ha | Starting point | Campaign scope |
| API_Retention_Rate | Parcels with data / Input | Data availability |
| Private_vs_Company_Split | Owner type distribution | Target audience |
| CatA_Filter_Impact | Residential / Private parcels | Filter effectiveness |
| Area_Flow_Per_Stage | Hectares retained at each step | Geographic coverage |
| Contact_Generation_Rate | Contacts / Parcels | Multiplication factor |
| Channel_Distribution_Area | Hectares by routing channel | Operational planning |

### Timeout Recovery System

## üìä Production Insights

Based on real campaign data analysis:

### Typical Campaign Profile
- **Input**: 1-5 parcels per municipality
- **Multiplication**: 1 parcel ‚Üí 20-70 raw records (multiple owners)
- **Reduction**: 93% fewer contacts after deduplication
- **Quality**: Better direct mail coverage with SNC addresses included
- **Companies**: 10-20% of parcels are company-owned (100% reachable via PEC)
- **Funnel Visibility**: Complete tracking of parcels and hectares at each stage

### Cost Structure
- **API calls**: ~‚Ç¨0.50 per parcel
- **Direct mail**: ~‚Ç¨0.20 per contact
- **Agency handling**: ~‚Ç¨0.70 per contact
- **Improved blended cost**: Expected reduction with SNC going to direct mail

### Optimization Opportunities
- SNC reclassification increases direct mail percentage
- Better funnel visibility enables targeted improvements
- Focus campaigns on high-yield municipalities
- Address Quality Intelligence (future) for further optimization

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Agency Routing for Non-SNC Addresses**
   - Cause: Missing street numbers or interpolated addresses
   - Solution: Focus on municipalities with complete addresses

2. **Timeout Errors**
   - Cause: API overload or network issues
   - Solution: Recovery system handles automatically

3. **Missing Sezione**
   - Cause: Required for some municipalities
   - Solution: Check SISTER portal before processing

4. **No Companies Found**
   - Normal for residential areas
   - Companies typically own 10-20% of parcels

### Performance Tips

- Process municipalities with <50 parcels first
- Run campaigns during Italian business hours
- Clear cache files older than 6 months
- Monitor API balance during large campaigns
