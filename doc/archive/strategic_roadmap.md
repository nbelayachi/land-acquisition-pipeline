- **Performance**: Processing 70 records ‚Üí 5 contacts (93% reduction)
- **Cost Efficiency**: ‚Ç¨0.50 saved per contact through smart routing

### Key Metrics Validated (v2.8)
| Metric | Current Performance | Business Impact |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Contact Reduction | 93% | Massive cost savings |
| Direct Mail Rate | 40% | Lower cost channel |
| Agency Rate | 60% | Higher cost channel |
| PEC Success | 100% | Instant B2B contact |
| Geocoding Success | 100% | Complete addresses |
| Cost per Contact | ‚Ç¨0.44 | Blended average |

### Expected Improvements (v2.9)
