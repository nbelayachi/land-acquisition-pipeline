## **GitHub Desktop Integration**

### **Setting Up Parallel Development**

#### **Step 1: Create Development Branches**
```bash
# In GitHub Desktop or terminal:
# 1. Create and switch to develop branch
git checkout -b develop

# 2. Create Track 1 branch (MVP enhancements)
git checkout -b feature/mvp-enhancements

# 3. Create Track 2 branch (Intelligent system)
git checkout -b research/intelligent-system

# 4. Push all branches to GitHub
git push -u origin develop
git push -u origin feature/mvp-enhancements
git push -u origin research/intelligent-system
```

#### **Step 2: GitHub Desktop Workflow**
1. **Current Work (Track 1 - MVP Enhancements)**:
   - Switch to `feature/mvp-enhancements` branch
   - Make incremental improvements to existing system
   - Test thoroughly before committing
   - Merge to `develop` when stable

2. **Future Work (Track 2 - Intelligent System)**:
   - Switch to `research/intelligent-system` branch
   - Build new components in parallel
   - Experiment freely without affecting production
   - Merge to `develop` only when proven

## **Development Workflow**

### **Track 1: MVP Enhancement Workflow**

#### **Sprint Planning (Weekly)**
```
Week N Planning:
1. Review current system performance
2. Identify highest-impact improvements
3. Plan small, testable enhancements
4. Implement and validate with real data
```

#### **Implementation Process**
```python
# Example enhancement workflow:
class MVPEnhancementWorkflow:
    """Workflow for implementing MVP enhancements"""
    
    def implement_enhancement(self, enhancement_name):
        """Safe implementation process"""
        steps = [
            "1. Create feature branch from feature/mvp-enhancements",
            "2. Implement enhancement with feature flag",
            "3. Add comprehensive tests",
            "4. Test with historical campaign data",
            "5. Document changes and impact",
            "6. Create pull request with evidence",
            "7. Code review and validation",
            "8. Merge to feature/mvp-enhancements",
            "9. Deploy with gradual rollout",
            "10. Monitor performance metrics"
