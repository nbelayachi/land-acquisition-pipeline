## üîß **CORE FUNCTIONS**

### **Campaign Launcher (Modernized v3.1.5)**
```python
LandAcquisitionCampaignLauncher.run()
```
- **Purpose**: Streamlined campaign setup and configuration
- **Features**: Input file selection, analysis preview, configuration generation
- **Improvements**: Reduced from 669 to 285 lines, focused on v3.1.5 features
- **Location**: `campaign_launcher.py`

### **Main Pipeline Entry Point**
```python
run_complete_campaign(excel_file_path, campaign_name)
```
- **Purpose**: Main orchestrator for entire campaign
- **Input**: Excel file path, campaign name
- **Output**: Single consolidated Excel file
- **Location**: Line ~1195 in `land_acquisition_pipeline.py`

### **Data Processing Functions**

#### **`create_consolidated_excel_output()`** (Line ~1589)
- **Purpose**: Generates final Excel with all 10 sheets
- **Enhanced Features**: Funnel analysis, quality distribution, PowerBI export

#### **`create_funnel_analysis_df()`** (Line ~1430)
- **Purpose**: Creates a dual funnel analysis (Land Acquisition + Contact Processing) with business-friendly labels and metrics.
- **Output**: A DataFrame with `Conversion / Multiplier`, `Retention_Rate`, `Stage_Conversion_Rate`, business rules, and process notes for each stage.
- **v3.1.3 Update**: Refined `Retention_Rate` calculation for Contact Processing funnel to be relative to "Owner Discovery" count. Added new `Stage_Conversion_Rate` column for step-wise efficiency.

#### **`create_quality_distribution_df()`** 
- **Purpose**: Analyzes address quality and generates a distribution summary.
- **Classification**: ULTRA_HIGH, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW confidence levels.
- **v3.1.1 Update**: Implemented a corrected rounding logic to ensure the sum of percentages is always exactly 100.0%.

#### **`calculate_executive_kpis()`**
- **Purpose**: Computes executive-level KPIs from the enhanced funnel data.
- **v3.1.2 Fix**: Updated the function to use the new business-friendly stage names from the `Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis` sheet, resolving a critical bug that caused the pipeline to fail.

### **Address Enhancement Functions**

#### **`classify_address_quality_enhanced()`**
- **Purpose**: 4-tier address confidence assessment
- **Logic**: Compares original vs geocoded data, assigns confidence score
- **v3.1.4 Update**: Refined logic to elevate certain `MEDIUM` confidence addresses to `HIGH` confidence if they are considered deliverable by the business (e.g., original address is reliable despite geocoding nuances).

#### **`extract_street_number_enhanced()`**
- **Purpose**: Conservative street number extraction from addresses

## üß™ **VALIDATION & TESTING**

### **`validate_campaign_metrics.py`**
- **Purpose**: A dedicated script (`dev_tools/testing/validate_campaign_metrics.py`) to perform automated checks on the generated Excel output.
- **Checks Performed**:
    - Verifies that the sum of percentages in `Address_Quality_Distribution` is exactly 100%.
    - Confirms that the total counts in `Address_Quality_Distribution` match the number of rows in `All_Validation_Ready`.
    - Validates the `Owner Discovery Multiplier` and `Address Expansion Multiplier` calculations in `Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis`.
    - Ensures consistency between summary metrics in `Campaign_Summary` and detailed data in `All_Validation_Ready`.
- **Usage**: Run this script with a completed campaign Excel file to quickly verify metric accuracy and consistency.
