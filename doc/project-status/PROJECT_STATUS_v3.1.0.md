feat: Implement enhanced funnel metrics with conversion rates and executive KPIs

BREAKING CHANGE: Enhanced funnel analysis replaces basic implementation

- Add comprehensive dual funnel structure (Land Acquisition + Contact Processing)
- Include conversion rate calculations between all pipeline stages
- Add business rule documentation for process transparency
- Implement address quality distribution with automation metrics
- Add executive KPI calculations for dashboard reporting
- Fix aggregation logic for campaign-level funnel analysis

Validated against real campaign data:
- 80% land acquisition efficiency tracked
- 17.4% zero-touch processing quantified
- 52.2% direct mail efficiency measured
- 2.9x contact multiplication factor calculated
- Data consistency verified across all sheets

Technical Changes:
- Enhanced create_funnel_analysis_df() with conversion rates
- Added create_quality_distribution_df() for address quality metrics
- Aggregated funnel creation from campaign summary data
- New Excel sheets: Enhanced_Funnel_Analysis + Address_Quality_Distribution
